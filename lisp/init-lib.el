(defmacro +add-hook! (hooks &rest rest)
  "A convenience macro for adding N functions to M hooks.

This macro accepts, in order:

  1. The mode(s) or hook(s) to add to. This is either an unquoted mode, an
     unquoted list of modes, a quoted hook variable or a quoted list of hook
     variables.
  2. Optional properties :local, :append, and/or :depth [N], which will make the
     hook buffer-local or append to the list of hooks (respectively),
  3. The function(s) to be added: this can be a quoted function, a quoted list
     thereof, a list of `defun' or `cl-defun' forms, or arbitrary forms (will
     implicitly be wrapped in a lambda).

If the hook function should receive an argument (like in
`enable-theme-functions'), the `args' variable can be expanded in the forms
